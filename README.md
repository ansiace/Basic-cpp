## Welcome to basic cpp programming üßë‚Äçüíª

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Structure of a C++ Program.

A simple C++ program consists of at least one main() function, which is the entry point of the program.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Types
C++ supports several built-in data types, including:

int: Integer
float: Floating point number
double: Double precision floating point number
char: Character
bool: Boolean

int myInt = 10;
float myFloat = 3.14;
double myDouble = 2.71828;
char myChar = 'A';
bool myBool = true;    

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Variables and Constants
Variables store data that can be modified later in the program, while constants hold data that cannot be changed.

int variable = 10;
const int constant = 100;

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Operators
C++ includes a variety of operators, such as:

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical: &&, ||, !
Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Control Structures
C++ has several control structures for decision making and loops:

if-else:

if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
switch:

switch (expression) {
    case constant1:
        // code to execute if expression equals constant1
        break;
    case constant2:
        // code to execute if expression equals constant2
        break;
    default:
        // code to execute if expression doesn't match any constant
}
for loop:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // code to execute in the loop
}
while loop:

while (condition) {
    // code to execute while condition is true
}
do-while loop:

do {
    // code to execute at least once
} while (condition);

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Functions
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be reused.

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.

code:
int myArray[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Pointers
Pointers store the memory address of another variable.

code:
int var = 10;
int* ptr = &var; // ptr holds the address of var


## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Classes and Objects
C++ is an object-oriented programming language that allows you to define classes.

code:
class MyClass {
public:
    int myNumber;
    void myFunction() {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // Create an object of MyClass
    obj.myNumber = 15;
    obj.myFunction();
    return 0;
}

## üîü Standard Library
C++ has a rich standard library that provides various functionalities, including input/output operations, string manipulations, and data structures.

iostream: for input/output stream
vector: dynamic array
string: string manipulation

code:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::string str = "Hello, World!";
    
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
    for (int i : vec) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

#### This is just an introduction to the basics of C++. There's much more to learn, such as advanced data structures, algorithms, templates, and more. If you have any specific questions or need further explanation on any topic, feel free to ask!

Here we'll start solving questions from basic to advanced level in cpp. From now will upload minimum 5 questions daily to improve our problem solving skills.It includes simple programs or scripts that demonstrate fundamental concepts like variables, control structures (loops and conditionals), functions, and basic input/output operations. Writing basic code is essential for beginners to understand programming logic, syntax, and problem-solving techniques.


### By understanding these basics, you can start writing your own code and build a foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts.


## Armstrong Number:

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number, pluperfect number, or pluperfect digital invariant) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
