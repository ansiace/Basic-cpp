## Welcome to basic cpp programming 

##1. Basic Structure of a C++ Program.
A simple C++ program consists of at least one main() function, which is the entry point of the program.

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;

##2. Data Types
C++ supports several built-in data types, including:

int: Integer
float: Floating point number
double: Double precision floating point number
char: Character
bool: Boolean
cpp
Copy code
int myInt = 10;
float myFloat = 3.14;
double myDouble = 2.71828;
char myChar = 'A';
bool myBool = true;    


    
This repository contains the basic c++ programming for logic building. here this rpository contains the array problems,here w'll cover from basic to advanced array problems.

## Basic about array
### Static Array
A static array has a fixed size that is determined at compile time.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Creating a static array
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Accessing elements
    cout << "First element: " << arr[0] << endl;  // Output: 1

    // Modifying elements
    arr[1] = 10;

    // Printing the array
    cout << "Array elements: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";  // Output: 1 10 3 4 5
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}


## 2D Array Library
### Overview
This 2D Array Library provides utilities for creating, manipulating, and performing operations on 2-dimensional arrays in c++.

###Features
Create 2D arrays with specified dimensions and initial values
Access and modify elements
Perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
Transpose arrays
Find the maximum, minimum, and sum of elements

## Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "radar" , "madam" , 121 , 1441 are palindromes.
To check if a given palindrome, you typically follow these steps:

1.Normalize the Input:
2.Reverse the given number or string:
3.Compare the Normalized String with its Reversed Version:
