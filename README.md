## Welcome to basic cpp programming üßë‚Äçüíª

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Structure of a C++ Program.

A simple C++ program consists of at least one main() function, which is the entry point of the program.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Types
C++ supports several built-in data types, including:

int: Integer
float: Floating point number
double: Double precision floating point number
char: Character
bool: Boolean

int myInt = 10;
float myFloat = 3.14;
double myDouble = 2.71828;
char myChar = 'A';
bool myBool = true;    

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Variables and Constants
Variables store data that can be modified later in the program, while constants hold data that cannot be changed.

int variable = 10;
const int constant = 100;

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Operators
C++ includes a variety of operators, such as:

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical: &&, ||, !
Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Control Structures
C++ has several control structures for decision making and loops:

if-else:

if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
switch:

switch (expression) {
    case constant1:
        // code to execute if expression equals constant1
        break;
    case constant2:
        // code to execute if expression equals constant2
        break;
    default:
        // code to execute if expression doesn't match any constant
}
for loop:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // code to execute in the loop
}
while loop:

while (condition) {
    // code to execute while condition is true
}
do-while loop:

do {
    // code to execute at least once
} while (condition);

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Functions
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be reused.

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.

code:
int myArray[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Pointers
Pointers store the memory address of another variable.

code:
int var = 10;
int* ptr = &var; // ptr holds the address of var


## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Classes and Objects
C++ is an object-oriented programming language that allows you to define classes.

code:
class MyClass {
public:
    int myNumber;
    void myFunction() {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // Create an object of MyClass
    obj.myNumber = 15;
    obj.myFunction();
    return 0;
}

## üîü Standard Library
C++ has a rich standard library that provides various functionalities, including input/output operations, string manipulations, and data structures.

iostream: for input/output stream
vector: dynamic array
string: string manipulation

code:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::string str = "Hello, World!";
    
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
    for (int i : vec) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

#### This is just an introduction to the basics of C++. There's much more to learn, such as advanced data structures, algorithms, templates, and more. If you have any specific questions or need further explanation on any topic, feel free to ask!

### This repository contains the basic c++ programming for logic building here it's contain problems based on cpp,here w'll cover from basic to advanced problems.

### Basic about array
### Static Array
A static array has a fixed size that is determined at compile time.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Creating a static array
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Accessing elements
    cout << "First element: " << arr[0] << endl;  // Output: 1

    // Modifying elements
    arr[1] = 10;

    // Printing the array
    cout << "Array elements: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";  // Output: 1 10 3 4 5
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}


## 2D Array Library
### Overview
This 2D Array Library provides utilities for creating, manipulating, and performing operations on 2-dimensional arrays in c++.

###Features
Create 2D arrays with specified dimensions and initial values
Access and modify elements
Perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
Transpose arrays
Find the maximum, minimum, and sum of elements

## Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "radar" , "madam" , 121 , 1441 are palindromes.
To check if a given palindrome, you typically follow these steps:

1.Normalize the Input:
2.Reverse the given number or string:
3.Compare the Normalized String with its Reversed Version:
